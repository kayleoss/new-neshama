        <p>It is best not to eat a heavy meal and drink alcoholic beverages for at least four hours before a treatment. It is better not to be fasting or extremely hungry before your treatment. Allow adequate time to get to your appointment so you are not rushed to arrive. Please do not wear perfume, cologne or heavy makeup to your appointments.</p>
        <p>Your first appointment will begin with a consultation of your health history, a discussion about your current symptoms and health conditions, and the goals of your treatment. Initial acupuncture treatments include an assessment, diagnosis and treatment, and normally requires a 90-minute session.</p>

        <h4>During &amp; After The Treatment</h4>
        <p>During your treatment, most parts of your body will be covered with a draped top sheet and a blanket. Your private parts will be covered at all times. Only the body part being treated will be undraped to ensure a comfortable and secure patient experience. At the end of your treatment, your therapist will leave the room and close the door for your privacy while you get dressed. When you are ready, they will return and discuss self-care techniques and dietary advice to help rebalance the body and boost energy.</p>
        <p>After-care of the treatment is to drink water in order to rehydrate and flush away any toxins that may have been released during treatment. An Epsom salt bath is recommended for sore muscles post-treatment.</p>
